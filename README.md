Heuristic Explanation:
----------------------

We consider that the vertex of the triangle is the goal for all marbles.
The utility is going to be the total distances of all marbles and the goal. 
The less the distance, the better the utility is going to be.
When any marble enter the opposite triangle, its distance becomes Zero.
